    "This project marks the end of my forskerlinje year and the beginning of my master thesis. The data is retrived from my FL-project, it is the answers to an open-end question participants provided after they were given an instruction to think as positively as possible when faced with an upcoming task. The question read: \"When faced with a challenge, how are you supposed to think?\" Our initial goal with this question was to check that participants acutally read the instruction, but as participants provided longer answers which highlighted how differently we percieve an instrcution to think positively, we wanted to use the answers as a basis for questions used in focus group interviews, which will be the first part of my master thesis. \n",
    "Therefore the goal of this analysis will be to understand how differently people percieve positive thinking, and which themes that are worth focusing on in a group discussion."
